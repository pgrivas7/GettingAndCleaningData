# Getting And Cleaning Data - Code Book

## Description

The data described below is for the output of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera class. This code book summarizes the data fields in `averagedMeasurementData.txt`. Additional data about the class can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning

## Source

The source data for this project is from the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at UCI. Thirty adult subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity data.

The output found in `averagedMeasurementData.txt` was generated by a R script  called `run_analysis.R`. Please see `README.md` for more information about the project. 


## Data Description

The data file has three main components:

* A subject identifier `SubjectID`
* An activity type `ActivityType`
* 64 columns of averaged values grouped and avereaged by SubjectID and ActivityType

`SubjectID`: is an integer from 1 to 30 representing the subjects in the study. We have no further information on what this value means. It is provided directly from the source data.
`ActivityType`: self explanatory...
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

# Introduction

This is a repo containing files for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

# Scripts

The repo contains one script file - `run_analysis.R`. 

This script will:

1. Download the Samsung data to the current working directory
2. Aggregate the training and test data into one data set
3. Average the mean and std. deviation columns in the complete data set
4. Output these averaged results to a file called `averagedMeasurementData.txt`

# Execution

Just run `run_analysis.R` in your chosen working directory and look for the resulting
averaged data in `averagedMeasurementData.txt`
